# Power Sun

The Power Sun is a printed circuit board that takes the power and HDD LED signals of a PC mainboard to create a beautifully animated concentric animation on 30 warm white LEDs at the front of your PC.

The hardware design is based on an STM32F042F6P6 micro processor and can be found on [oshwlab.com/jostsalathe/power-sun](https://oshwlab.com/jostsalathe/power-sun).

This repository contains firmware source files for the micro controller as well as software source files for the program that controls the parameters of the Power Sun from the host computer via USB.
